# An array is an ordered list of objects.
#
# We often use the word “elements” to describe the items 
# inside the array.
#
# The array itself is an object. 
# Think of a box in the real world. 
# A box can hold multiple items inside of it. 
# The box is an object and the items inside of it are objects as well.
